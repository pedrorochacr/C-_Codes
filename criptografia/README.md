Exercise that consists of reading an encrypted message from a text file and printing the decrypted message to standard output. The encryption technique used is that of block codes, which consists of subdividing the message into blocks of several letters and scrambling these blocks. Before, the Caesar cipher with left rotation of five positions is used. After encoding the message, 5 bits are added at the beginning of the message string containing the binary number that corresponds to the position of the string where an extra character will be added that must be discarded in the decoding.
